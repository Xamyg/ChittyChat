# ChittyChat
Distributed Systems Handin 3
To run the program first run server/server.go, then, in a separate terminal run client/client.go.
You can specify a name for your client with the parameter --name=NAME (default name is Anonymous).
All names will send the same example chats, except --name=Johan and --name=Xander which have unique chats.
To easily run 3 clients simultaneously, use --name=Triple. This will open 3 terminals with the names, Johan, Xander and Bob (requires access to either cmd for Windows or the GNOME terminal for Linux and MacOS).
